#### As the Executioner:
    1. You should be able to input and submit a valid* word for the Hangee to guess.

    Valid Word - length greater than three(3) and contains so special characters
    like: " " , . ! @ #

# Hangee Screen:

#### As the Hangee:
    1. You should be able to click on each letter (once) to check against the
    Excutioners Word.

    2. You will have six guesses before you are hung on the gallows.

# Win / Lose Screen:

#### As the Hangee:
    You will recieve 100 points if you have guessed the word correctly and saved your life.

#### As the Executioner:
    You will recieve 100 points if your word is not guess and hung the Hangee.

#### Now the roles have reversed:
    The Executioner becomes the Hangee.
                   and
    The Hangee becomes the Executioner.

This is indicated by the style in the scoreboard. The Executioner will always be
red and the Hangee will always be blue. Each game the colors will switch.
